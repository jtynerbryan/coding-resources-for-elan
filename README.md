# Coding Resources for Elan

1.  The [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/)'s free online courses at [Learn.co](https://learn.co/sign_up) are fantastic.

* For me they were a fun and effective way to learn the fundamentals of programming. Once you sign up, they'll walk you through setting up an IDE (an application/environment where you write code) and a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (where lots of developers hold and maintain their code in repositories).

2.  Once you've got that set up, I think you should try out a couple of their introductory courses.

* [Intro to JavaScript](https://learn.co/courses/introduction-to-javascript)

  * JavaScript is a language originally used to make web pages dynamic (interactive) but is now used for literally everything.
  * [Official JS documentaion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

* [Intro to Ruby](https://learn.co/courses/introduction-to-ruby)
  * Ruby is a beautiful, elegant general purpose language designed for our [productivity and enjoyment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_programming_language#Philosophy)
  * [Official Ruby Documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/)
* If you really enjoy these, [Bootcamp Prep](https://learn.co/courses/bootcamp-prep) is the continuation of these courses.

### Other good resources

* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  * easy to understand tutorials and references on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more.
* [google](https://www.google.com/)
  * Looking up stuff is a huge part of this. You're going to get stuck, see errors, write bugs etc. But your questions's have already been asked and solutions have been provided. Google an error or a how to, and you'll probably see results from [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). This is a good thing! Follow these links and you'll get some great explanations/solutions. You probably won't understand some of the stuff you see there, and that's totally ok. You just want to get your code to work write now.

### Final Thoughts

* Programming is less about memorizing stuff or how much you know, and more about problem solving and what you can figure out. And it's fine to forget things because it's all just a google search away!
* If you're really stuck on a problem, sometimes the best thing to do is leave it for an hour or 2. A lot of times when you come back the answer will present itself quickly.
* Have fun!
